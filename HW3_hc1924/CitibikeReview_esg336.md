# Peer Review of Citi Bike Assignment


## a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly

First of all; I think it is very intesting idea analizing what kind of user are divide by age are more prone to use citibike. I might say that I found the statement of the idea a little big vague. At first , I read the sentence and I stopped thinking in the concept of older and young. I would rephrase it in a more clear way, something like: " Idea: People who has over 45 years old are less prone to use Citibike than younger users." Also it could have been interesting the idea of frame the group a little bit more. I think that in general as people age will be less likely to bike in general. So, probably the two groups are too broad, and it have benn very interesting exploring the idea of having two groups equaly frame - in age. For example: a group of young from 15 years old to 45 years old, and a mature mature or adult gruop from 45 years old to 75.

Anyway, I like the idea and once you read the hypothesis , we find it clear enough.

What it is not so clear for me , it is the way you stated the hypothesis. It seems to be that your hypothesis linked the idea with commutes as that the reason you separate between weekdays and weekends( recreational).

The Null Hypothesis is well stated considering that most likely you are trying to analyse which group of people use less in Weekdays against the weekends. I think that if not it is more simple,and it would be something like:

**Ho**: The number of user over 45 years old is greater or equal Citibike than younger users
**Ho**: O45/Total Users >= B45/Total Users 

**Ha**: The number of user over 45 years are lesser than the number of user who belings to younger
**Ha**: O45/Total Users < B45/Total Users 

I would think that it is who commute more , It is missning the alternative hypothesis stated in words, such as :" The ratio of people over 45 years old biking on weekends over people biking on weekdays is the less than the ratio of people under 45 years old biking over weekends to people below biking on weekdays".

Also it is well formulated.

## b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test has not been chosen yet)

The data set is clear, and you reduce properly the data to use only what it is in your needs. My remark in here is that you use the same data that Federica uses in her example and i encourage the use of another data set just for the sake of explore other values.

Also , the way that you broadcast the age is nice although converting the date of birth into real age it have been more interesting. You can implement now with the code seen this week.

Anyways, it is very well done. However , I think that analises of the ratio is missing and it is one step more to go to have the ratio normalize in a scatterplot.

But what concerns to data , it is well chosen and supports the project.

## c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.

We would like to question: "The ratio of people over 45 years old biking on weekends over people biking on weekdays is the same or higher than the ratio of people under 45 years old biking over weekends to people below biking on weekdays"

I would perform t-Test due to my independant variable is dichotomous because the dependant variable is the age (over or below 45) and the independent variable will be rides on days that will be continous. wE can succefully answer the question about the differences between tow groups.

Also it is possible to perform qui squared considering categorical the independent variable (women or men) and it is also categorical the days of the weeks. so it can be tested and we can succesfully answer the question whether there are differences between groups.
